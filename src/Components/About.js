       <b><u>ABOUT THE APP:</u></b><br/>
    Our app suggests doctors who are available in a radius of 7 Km. Firstly, it gives you priority over doctors and hospitals around a radius of 5 Km. Once the symptoms are enrolled or any picture of physical injury or illness is uploaded, HARGLIM makes work easy and easier to find the best suitable doctor and hospital nearby. Once the patient approaches the doctor from the results he got, and if the patient clicks on the button “TREATMENT DONE”, then the doctor gets a message to approve. If the doctor clicks on the approve button, then the app updates the services done by the doctor like how many members this particular doctor gave treatment, to and what kind of treatment the doctor gave for a particular patient. 
    All the accounts have the option to follow professional accounts. A professional one has a following, and follow option while a user account has only follow option.
    Users can chat with the doctor through the inbox provided in the app. This inbox gets activated if a patient approaches a doctor at least once. A patient can give a review to a doctor for his services. So that, patients can choose the doctor by having a look at the reviews and comments.
    Users need not choose the existing symptoms or pictures. But they can manually enter the symptoms, can upload the pictures, and find a suitable doctor first, then the hospital.
    Our app has a specialized feature to book appointments with the doctor shown by the app after entering the symptoms. This makes the user feel comfortable as there is no need to wait for long minutes or hours to meet the doctor at the hospital.
    People often can search for the doctor by entering their name manually, and details of the hospital too. But, this won’t allow the user to book an appointment. The app grants the permission once the user gets done by entering their symptoms.
    Enabling mobile location while using the app is mandatory. Once the location gets off, immediately, the app exits.
